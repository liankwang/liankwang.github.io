  <p class="caption">The four of us (my parents, me, and Leo) spent two weeks in Japan, including a road trip through southern Japan. It was a really enjoyable trip for us — seeing the country on the road, taking lots of unplanned stops and detours — but less recommended for those who want less hecticness, less driving (2000km over 7 days), and more certainty.</p>

When they were young, they went looking for it based on its location as described in written records, and asked around before one villager knew of it and brought them there. They got to see the temple before a raid in 1999 that destroyed many of the Tang statues, and of course before it became more accessible and traveled like now. This is the kind of adventure that I always 向往 the most.</p>

            <p class="caption"> I think one of the unique and powerful things about museums is that, by virtue of making you physically travel there and walk through the space, they have the potential to bridge the gap between your sensing/feeling self and the ideas you only interact with intellectually. To bridge this gap is really the primary reason we (at least, I) travel at all. It is rare for a museum to do this for me, but the Peace Museum in Hiroshima definitely did.</p>

This is one of the unequal treaties that epitomizes the humiliation of late Qing China, which really are an important part of the contemporary Chinese psyche. There was an exhibit at the hotel where the treaty was signed, which preserved the original conference table and even marked the chair where 李鸿章 sat. Also, apparently Shimonoseki is known for fugu (pufferfish) sashimi, which we tried at Karato Fish Market.</p>

            <p class="caption"> The Shimazu garden and residence was also really, really nice. The garden was designed against the backdrop of Sakurajima, an active volcano on the water. This was easily my favorite garden (and probably favorite place) in the whole trip. There is a naturalness to this garden right on the water in the southern reaches of Japan that none of the gardens in Kyoto have. It was really just beautiful and not overly intricate.</p>
